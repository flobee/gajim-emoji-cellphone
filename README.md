Unicode Emojis for Gajim
========================

This is a set of unicode emojis (or emoticons) for [Gajim], an XMPP client.
It makes Gajim display emojis sent by Android or Apple devices nicely and enables Gajim users to themselves send Unicode emojis.

It is based on [EmojiOne] with an automatically generated and only slightly modified index file attached to it so that Gajim can handle the icons correctly.
I manually added all ASCII codes the original “static“ emoticon pack that comes with Gajim supports (and a few more), but will gladly accept patches with more such additions.
